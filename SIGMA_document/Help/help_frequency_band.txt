The EEG is typically described in terms of rhythmic activity and transients.
The rhythmic activity is divided into bands by frequency. To some degree, 
these frequency bands are a matter of nomenclature 
(i.e., any rhythmic activity between 8–12 Hz can be described as "alpha"), 
but these designations arose because rhythmic activity within a certain 
frequency range was noted to have a certain distribution over the scalp or
 a certain biological significance. Frequency bands are usually extracted 
using spectral methods (for instance Welch) as implemented for instance in
 freely available EEG software such as EEGLAB or the Neurophysiological 
Biomarker Toolbox. 
Computational processing of the EEG is often named quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG).
Most of the cerebral signal observed in the scalp EEG falls in the 
range of 1–20 Hz 
(activity below or above this range is likely to be artifactual, 
under standard clinical recording techniques).
Waveforms are subdivided into bandwidths known as alpha, beta, 
theta, and delta to signify the majority of the EEG used in clinical practice.
