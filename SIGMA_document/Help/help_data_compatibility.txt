To load correctly the data (subject), the file should be a matfile and
have a name with format subject_xx.mat, where xx is the number of the
subject (01, 02, 14,...).
This matlab file must contain a structure named:"s_EEG" and this structure 
should contain at least these fields : 
	data : [16×20000×14 double]
    labels : [1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2]
    subject_number : 1
    sampling_rate : 2000
    channel_names : {1×16 cell}
If the data format is correct, the toolbox displays the subjects in the 
textbox. For mor detail please refer to the SIGMA Manual (SIGMA_document),
