LOEO : Leave One Epoch/Example Out
Leave only one example out and train with all the rest of the example. When the training is over, the prediction is computed on the one leaved example.
This process is repeated m times until the examples are all used.
Note : In the case of custom feature classification, only the LOEO should used.
