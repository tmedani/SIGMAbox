Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. LDA attempt to express one dependent variable as a linear combination of other features or measurements, LDA analysis has a categorical dependent variable (i.e. the class label). Discriminant analysis is used when groups are known a priori (supervised learning). 
Matlab has an implementation of the LDA algorithm: the ‘fitcdiscr’ function. LDA in SIGMA box is based on this function.
