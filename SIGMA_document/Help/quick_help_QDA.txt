Quadratique Discriminant analysis (QDA) is quadratic classifier used in machine learning and statistical classification to separate measurements of two or more classes of objects or events by a quadric surface. It is a more general version of the linear classifier. Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) is closely related to linear discriminant analysis (LDA). QDA creates a longer measurement vector from the old one by adding all pairwise products of individual measurements (cross terms ref ). Finding a quadratic classifier for the original measurements would then become the same as finding a linear classifier based on the expanded measurement vector. As for the LDA, QDA in SIGMA box is based on built in Matlab function.
