The feature extraction process is used to extract the feature (or the descriptor)
from the data (EEG siganls in this case).              
The output of this process is stored in a matrix  with the size (N x M) 
where N is the number of features and M is the number of examples ( or epochs).

The linear separability is a test based on the perceptron algorithm to check if the 
data stored in the feature matrix could be separated by a linear method.                                
                                                       
For advanced user, the the eature matrix is stored in the 'feature_result' structure,
user can extract this matrice by exporting the SIGMA results to Matlab using the 
push button  'Export to Matlab' or with a right click on on the 'Feature Matrix' panel 
then 'export to matlab ', this will generate two structure in matlab workspace.
Then use this code on the terminal to extract the feature matrix:
feature_matrix = feature_result.o_feature_matrix.
More information could be found on the 'feature_result' structure.
