Support Vector Machines (SVM), also known as support vector networks, is also a supervised learning models with robuste learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using different kernel, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
