This section is dedicated to the processing of selected data before the feature selection and the training of the machine learning algorithms. To select subject from the previous panel to the current panel, user has just to double click on the subject on the available subject list.
The selected subjects list correspond to the subjects that will be used to compute the machine learning algorithms. To select a subject, the user can double click on the subject name in the “available subject” list or using the right arrow behind this list. On the contrary, if the user wants to remove a subject from the selected subject list, he can double click on the subject name on the “selected subject” list or click on the left arrow behind the “selected subject” list.
One the subjects are selected, the user must select the frequency band of the signal that will be used to compute the machine learning algorithm. A frequency band is selected through filtering of the raw signals. The user can select several frequency band corresponding to broadly accepted definitions in the EEG community. Not selecting any frequency band will block the progression of the user in the GUI, as at least one frequency band must be selected to train a machine learning model.
In this section, ‘2 – Data Processing ’, user can select the desired subject to study by double click on the ‘Available subject’ list to add them on the ‘Selected subject’ list. Also He can display information about the selected subject by right clicks on the listbox > Get information about selected subject.
