%% This function use a system of vote in order to find wich is the best 
% index of the feature to select from a liste od OFR based on cross
% correlation OFR by counting the number of apparition in the best feature
% matrix. The input is the outpu of the OFR for each itteration, The output
% is ranked according to the number of apparition during all the iteration
% index_selected : should be a matrix, the number of the line corespond to
% the number of the best feature selected from the OFR, 
% the number of coulumn should be the number of epochs (example) from the
% data.

% TODO : make a test to ensure that the number of the line corespond to the
% number of the best feature to rank, and the number of column is equal to the number of the epochs...
