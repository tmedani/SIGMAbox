This file is part of SIGMA toolbox

This directory contain the function associated to the feature extraction for the time series signals. 

The functions are organised as in the name : 
Features from the Amplitude of the time series:

Function name : 

Amplitude_xx
	Function related to extract the feature from the amplitude 	of the time series 
	Where xx is the name of the method
		Example: Amplitude_mean compute the mean of the 				amplitude of 	the time series signals

Amplitude_enveloppe_xx
	Function related to extract the feature from the amplitude 	of the enveloppe of the time series signal
	Where xx is the name of the method
		Example: Amplitude_enveloppe_std computes the standard 		deviation of the envellopp e of 			the  of 			the time 			series 			signals
